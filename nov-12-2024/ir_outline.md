Slide 1: Title Slide

Title: Transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography Standards (NIST IR 8547 & CNSA 2.0)

Subtitle: Aligning with NSM10 and the 2035 Timeline

Your Name and Date

Slide 2: Overview and Context

NIST IR 8547 and CNSA 2.0:

Both are responses to NSM10, which sets 2035 as the goal for PQC adoption.

CNSA 2.0 focuses on commercial products for NSA use.

NIST IR 8547 addresses broader industry and government needs.


Common Objective:

Transition critical systems to post-quantum cryptography by 2035.




---

Slide 3: Key Challenges Addressed in NIST IR 8547

1. Infrastructure Changes:

Libraries, PKI, cryptographic hardware, protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec).



2. Security Concern:

"Harvest Now, Decrypt Later" threat.



3. Gradual Migration:

Use of hybrid cryptographic solutions during the transition phase.

Slide 4: Asymmetric Key Algorithm Standards

NIST Standards for Post-Quantum Cryptography:

FIPS 203: CRYSTALS-Kyber (Key Encapsulation Mechanism).

FIPS 204: CRYSTALS-Dilithium (Digital Signatures).

FIPS 205: SPHINCS+ (Stateless Hash-Based Signatures).


Future Algorithms:

NIST continues to evaluate additional algorithms for standardization.

Selection process described in other NIST documents.




---

Slide 5: Security Levels and Target Use Cases

Security Levels:

Based on categories like key size (e.g., 128-bit, 256-bit).


Target Algorithms for Different Purposes:

Digital Signatures: CRYSTALS-Dilithium, SPHINCS+.

Key Establishment: CRYSTALS-Kyber.

Symmetric Algorithms: AES and SHA remain secure at â‰¥128 bits.

Slide 6: The Role of Hybrid Cryptography

Why Hybrid?:

Combines quantum-vulnerable and quantum-resistant algorithms.

Ensures security even if one algorithm is compromised.


Temporary Measure:

Helps maintain compatibility during the transition.

Reduces risks and allows gradual integration of PQC algorithms.

Slide 7: Closing Thoughts

1. Unified Goal (2035):

NSM10 drives both NIST IR 8547 and CNSA 2.0 to ensure widespread PQC adoption.



2. Next Steps:

Begin migrating critical infrastructure now.

Leverage hybrid solutions to bridge the gap.
